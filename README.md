# Cocktail Bar Sales Performance Analysis

Business intelligence case study analyzing sales and inventory data from multiple bars operating within a single food hall to support managerial decision-making.

## Scenario / Background

This project analyzes sales performance of a single cocktail bar operating within a food hall environment.

The bar offers a curated cocktail menu alongside selected beers, spirits, and soft drinks. 
Despite having access to detailed sales and product cost data, 
management lacks a structured analytical view of product performance and beverage cost efficiency.

The analysis covers Q1 2025 (January–March) and focuses on sales-driven insights supported by reference product cost data.

## Business Task (ASK Phase)

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate product-level sales performance and estimated beverage cost efficiency for a cocktail bar operating within a food hall.

The analysis aims to identify:
- top-performing products and categories,
- products with potentially inefficient cost-to-price ratios,
- opportunities to optimize pricing, menu composition, and overall profitability.

## Data Source & Disclaimer

The datasets used in this project are based on the author’s professional experience in food & beverage operations and are designed to closely resemble real-world sales and product cost data from a bar environment.

All data has been anonymized and modified for analytical purposes. Product names, prices, quantities, and cost structures are representative and do not reflect actual commercial agreements, supplier pricing, or proprietary business information.

The datasets are intended solely for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation (PREPARE Phase)

The raw datasets required multiple cleaning and standardization steps
before analysis. The cleaning process focused on improving data consistency,
ensuring correct data types, and preparing the data for aggregation and joins.
