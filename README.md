# Food Hall Sales Performance Analysis

Business intelligence case study analyzing sales and inventory data from multiple bars operating within a single food hall to support managerial decision-making.

## 📌 Scenario / Background

A food hall operates multiple bars under a single management structure.
Each bar sells a variety of products and manages its own inventory, generating
large volumes of sales and stock data.

Despite having access to this data, managers lack a unified view of product
performance across all bars. As a result, decisions related to pricing,
product assortment, and inventory management are often based on intuition
rather than data-driven insights.

This project aims to consolidate and analyze sales and inventory data to provide
actionable insights that support better managerial decision-making.

## 🎯 Business Task (ASK Phase)

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate product-level sales and inventory
performance across multiple bars within a single food hall in order to identify
top-performing products, loss-generating items, and opportunities to improve
profitability and operational efficiency.
